# Fake News Detection Web App

## Overview
This project is a machine learning–based web application that detects fake news by analyzing the textual content of news articles. It uses natural language processing techniques and a Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a news article is real or fake.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Naïve Bayes  

## Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF  
- Fake news classification using Naïve Bayes  
- Real-time prediction by accepting news article URLs  
- Web scraping to extract article content automatically  
- Simple Flask-based web interface for user interaction  

## Workflow
1. Input a news article URL or text  
2. Extract and preprocess the article content  
3. Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF  
4. Classify the article using a trained Naïve Bayes model  
5. Display the prediction result as real or fake  

## Model Performance
- Achieved 85% accuracy using cross-validation on the dataset
